### Introduction
Dikstra algorithm, to find least cost path in a graph.
C++ terminal program designed for Ubuntu. 

### include file:      
- READEME
- digraph.h
- dijkstra.cpp
- dijkstra.h
- heap.h
- server.cpp
- wdigraph.h
- Makefile
- edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt

### Running process:
1. type "make" in the terminal.
2. Needs "edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt" (provided) to run.
3. Use argument: ./server < input.txt > output.txt to construct output text file.
4. Use make clean to remove objectives and executable.
